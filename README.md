Features
===

#### Optimized pool server
* TCP (stratum-like) protocol for server-push based jobs
* Compared to old HTTP protocol, this has a higher hash rate, lower network/CPU server load, lower orphan block percent, and less error prone
* Support for Cryptonight (Original, Monero v7, Stellite v7), Cryptonight Light (Original, Aeon v7, IPBC), Cryptonight Heavy (Ombre), Cryptonight Pico (Zent Cash), Argon2 (Ninjacoin, Bitcoin Nova, Turtlecoin) and RandomX (Monero) algorithms.
* Custom API to support coins based on Zent Cash, Ninjacoin, Bitcoin Nova and Turtlecoin (Restful API)
* IP banning to prevent low-diff share attacks
* Socket flooding detection
* Share trust algorithm to reduce share validation hashing CPU load
* Clustering for vertical scaling
* Ability to configure multiple ports - each with their own difficulty
* Miner login (wallet address) validation
* Workers identification (specify worker name as the password)
* Variable difficulty / share limiter
* Set fixed difficulty on miner client by passing "address" param with "+[difficulty]" postfix
* Modular components for horizontal scaling (pool server, database, stats/API, payment processing, front-end)
* SSL support for both pool and API servers
* RBPPS (PROP) payment system

#### Live statistics API
* Currency network/block difficulty
* Current block height
* Network hashrate
* Pool hashrate
* Each miners' individual stats (hashrate, shares submitted, pending balance, total paid, payout estimate, etc)
* Blocks found (pending, confirmed, and orphaned)
* Historic charts of pool's hashrate, miners count and coin difficulty
* Historic charts of users's hashrate and payments

#### Mined blocks explorer
* Mined blocks table with block status (pending, confirmed, and orphaned)
* Blocks luck (shares/difficulty) statistics
* Universal blocks and transactions explorer

#### Smart payment processing
* Splintered transactions to deal with max transaction size
* Minimum payment threshold before balance will be paid out
* Minimum denomination for truncating payment amount precision to reduce size/complexity of block transactions
* Prevent "transaction is too big" error with "payments.maxTransactionAmount" option
* Option to enable dynamic transfer fee based on number of payees per transaction and option to have miner pay transfer fee instead of pool owner (applied to dynamic fee only)
* Control transactions priority with config.payments.priority (default: 0).
* Set payment ID on miner client when using "[address].[paymentID]" login
* Integrated payment ID addresses support for Exchanges

#### Admin panel
* Aggregated pool statistics
* Coin daemon & wallet RPC services stability monitoring
* Log files data access
* Users list with detailed statistics

#### Pool stability monitoring

Usage
===

#### Requirements
* Coin daemon(s) (find the coin's repo and build latest version from source)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v18.0+
  * For Ubuntu: 
 ```
  sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev curl
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
 ```
  
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ 
  * For Ubuntu: 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/redis-server
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install redis-server
 ```
 Dont forget to tune redis-server:
 ```
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo 1024 > /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn
 ```
 Add this lines to your /etc/rc.local and make it executable
 ```
 chmod +x /etc/rc.local
 ```
 
* libssl required for the node-multi-hashing module
  * For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`

* Boost is required for the cryptoforknote-util module
  * For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`
  
* libsodium  
  * For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev`

* libgmp-dev
  * For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev`

* build-essential
  * For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`

##### Seriously
Those are legitimate requirements. If you use old versions of Node.js or Redis that may come with your system package manager then you will have problems. Follow the linked instructions to get the last stable versions.

[**Redis warning**](http://redis.io/topics/security): It'sa good idea to learn about and understand software that
you are using - a good place to start with redis is [data persistence](http://redis.io/topics/persistence).

**Do not run the pool as root** : create a new user without ssh access to avoid security issues :
```bash
sudo adduser --disabled-password --disabled-login your-user
```
To login with this user : 
```
sudo su - your-user
```

#### 1) Downloading & Installing


Clone the repository and run `npm update` for all the dependencies to be installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZentCashFoundation/cryptonote-nodejs-pool.git pool
cd pool

npm update
```

#### 2) Configuration

Copy the `config_examples/COIN.json` file of your choice to `config.json` then overview each options and change any to match your preferred setup.

        }
    }

```

#### 3) Start the pool

```bash
node init.js
```

The file `config.json` is used by default but a file can be specified using the `-config=file` command argument, for example:

```bash
node init.js -config=config_backup.json
```

This software contains four distinct modules:
* `pool` - Which opens ports for miners to connect and processes shares
* `api` - Used by the website to display network, pool and miners' data
* `unlocker` - Processes block candidates and increases miners' balances when blocks are unlocked
* `payments` - Sends out payments to miners according to their balances stored in redis
* `chartsDataCollector` - Processes miners and workers hashrate stats and charts
* `telegramBot`	- Processes telegram bot commands


By default, running the `init.js` script will start up all four modules. You can optionally have the script start only start a specific module by using the `-module=name` command argument, for example:

```bash
node init.js -module=api
```

[Example screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/SEgrI3b.png) of running the pool in single module mode with tmux.

To keep your pool up, on operating system with systemd, you can create add your pool software as a service.  
Use this [example](https://github.com/ZentCashFoundation/cryptonote-nodejs-pool/blob/master/deployment/linux-automation/coins-standard-api/coin-pool.service) to create the systemd service `/lib/systemd/system/coin-pool.service`
Then enable and start the service with the following commands : 

```
sudo systemctl enable cryptonote-nodejs-pool.service
sudo systemctl start cryptonote-nodejs-pool.service
```

#### 4) Host the front-end

Simply host the contents of the `website_example` directory on file server capable of serving simple static files.


Edit the variables in the `website_example/config.js` file to use your pool's specific configuration.
Variable explanations:

```javascript

/*  Currency Name */
var parentCoin = "coin";

/* Must point to the API setup in your config.json file. */
var api = "http://poolhost:8117";

/* Contact email address. */
var email = "support@poolhost.com";

/* Pool Telegram URL. */
var telegram = "https://t.me/YourPool";

/* Pool Discord URL */
var discord = "https://discordapp.com/invite/YourPool";

/* Market stat display params from https://www.cryptonator.com/widget */
var marketCurrencies = ["{symbol}-BTC", "{symbol}-USD", "{symbol}-EUR", "{symbol}-CAD"];

/* Any custom CSS theme for pool frontend */
var themeCss = "themes/light.css";

/* Default language */
var defaultLang = 'en';

```

#### 5) Customize your website

The following files are included so that you can customize your pool website without having to make significant changes to `index.html` or other front-end files thus reducing the difficulty of merging updates with your own changes:
* `custom.css` for creating your own pool style
* `custom.js` for changing the functionality of your pool website


Then simply serve the files via nginx, Apache, Google Drive, or anything that can host static content.

#### SSL

You can configure the API to be accessible via SSL using various methods. Find an example for nginx below:

* Using SSL api in `config.json`:

By using this you will need to update your `api` variable in the `website_example/config.js`. For example:  
`var api = "https://poolhost:8119";`

* Inside your SSL Listener, add the following:

``` javascript
location ~ ^/api/(.*) {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8117/$1$is_args$args;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```

By adding this you will need to update your `api` variable in the `website_example/config.js` to include the /api. For example:  
`var api = "http://poolhost/api";`

You no longer need to include the port in the variable because of the proxy connection.

* Using his own subdomain, for example `api.poolhost.com`:

```bash
server {
    server_name api.poolhost.com
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    
    ssl_certificate /your/ssl/certificate;
    ssl_certificate_key /your/ssl/certificate_key;

    location / {
        more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *';
        proxy_pass http://127.0.01:8117;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

By adding this you will need to update your `api` variable in the `website_example/config.js`. For example:  
`var api = "//api.poolhost.com";`

You no longer need to include the port in the variable because of the proxy connection.

#### Upgrading
When updating to the latest code its important to not only `git pull` the latest from this repo, but to also update the Node.js modules, and any config files that may have been changed.
* Inside your pool directory (where the init.js script is) do `git pull` to get the latest code.
* Remove the dependencies by deleting the `node_modules` directory with `rm -r node_modules`.
* Run `npm update` to force updating/reinstalling of the dependencies.
* Compare your `config.json` to the latest example ones in this repo or the ones in the setup instructions where each config field is explained. You may need to modify or add any new changes.

### JSON-RPC API Commands from CLI

Documentation for JSON-RPC commands can be found here:
* Daemon https://wiki.bytecoin.org/wiki/JSON_RPC_API
* Wallet https://wiki.bytecoin.org/wiki/Wallet_JSON_RPC_API


Curl can be used to use the JSON-RPC commands from command-line. Here is an example of calling `getblockheaderbyheight` for block 100:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:18081/json_rpc -d '{"method":"getblockheaderbyheight","params":{"height":100}}'
```

### JSON-RPC Restful API Commands from CLI (Zent Cash, Cirquity, Bitcoin Nova, Turtlecoin...)

* 1- Run daemon with enable-blockexplorer command
```bash
./Zentd --enable-blockexplorer 
```
* 2- Run the wallet-api with coinbase transaction  
```bash
./wallet-api --scan-coinbase-transactions  --rpc-password yourRpcPasssword (Not wallet password)  
```
* 3-Open the wallet with Curl command 
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:21699/wallet/open" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-API-KEY: yourRpcPasssword" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"daemonHost\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"daemonPort\": 21698, \"filename\": \"/your/wallet/file/address/name.wallet\", \"password\": \"YourWalletPassword\"}"
```

### Monitoring Your Pool

* To inspect and make changes to redis I suggest using [redis-commander](https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander)
* To monitor server load for CPU, Network, IO, etc - I suggest using [Netdata](https://github.com/firehol/netdata)
* To keep your pool node script running in background, logging to file, and automatically restarting if it crashes - I suggest using [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) or [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)
